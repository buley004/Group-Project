# Ballads and Brews


## Overview
Ballads and Brews is an application that allows the user to search for a local concert happening TONIGHT with an option of dinner or drinks around the show. The UI will have an all-inclusive search that bundles the style of music the user wants to see, type of food the user likes, and bars ALL within a short mile radius of each other. The idea here is that the user does not have to go to more than one search engine to find a concert happening and another search engine to find food or drinks. Everything is included on one page!
